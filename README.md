# LLaMA Model Implementation with ExecutorTorch

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the LLaMA model architecture converted to PTE (Parameter-Transformers-Efficient) format, optimized for efficient deployment using ExecutorTorch. This implementation enables efficient model execution across various hardware platforms, making it ideal for edge devices and mobile deployment.

## Key Features
- âš¡ Optimized LLaMA architecture in PTE format
- ðŸš€ ExecutorTorch integration for efficient deployment
- ðŸ“± Cross-platform compatibility (mobile, edge devices)
- ðŸ’» Hardware-specific optimizations
- ðŸ“¦ Reduced binary size and memory footprint
- ðŸ”„ Streamlined inference pipeline

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch 2.0+
- ExecutorTorch
